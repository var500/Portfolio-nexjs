## Overview

Mersive Solstice is a market-leading platform that transforms meeting spaces into intelligent collaboration hubs. It is not just about screen sharing; it is a comprehensive operating system for the meeting room.

As a Senior Developer, I drive the engineering behind the platform's core capabilities on macOS and the cloud. My role focuses on the convergence of **Wireless Screen Sharing** and **Hybrid Meetings**, ensuring that users can seamlessly share content and connect to remote participants without grappling with cables or complex AV setups.

## Key Features

- **Wireless Screen Sharing & AV Routing**:
  - Engineered the core logic for high-performance wireless content sharing, allowing multiple users to stream 4K content simultaneously from any device.
  - Implemented intelligent **AV Routing** algorithms within the local Python daemon to dynamically manage audio/video signal paths, automatically switching between local HDMI inputs and wireless streams based on active user context.
- **Hybrid Meeting (BYOM) Support**:
  - Built the "Bring Your Own Meeting" architecture using **WebRTC** and **React Native**. This allows users to wirelessly connect the room’s camera and audio peripherals to their laptop, bridging the gap between the physical room and remote platforms like Zoom or Teams.
- **Digital Signage Integration**:
  - Developed features that maximize hardware ROI by converting idle meeting displays into **Digital Signage** endpoints. Integrated HTML5-based playback engines to render corporate communications, dashboards, or emergency alerts when the room is not in active use.
- **System-Level macOS Integration**:
  - Created custom **PKG and DMG** installers and managed Apple Notarization to ensure the Solstice client has the deep OS permissions required to capture screens and route system audio securely.
- **Cloud Management & Analytics**:
  - Scaled the backend microservices (Node.js/Firebase) to support fleet management, allowing administrators to configure Digital Signage feeds and monitor AV routing health across thousands of deployed units.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For the unified user interface across user devices and room displays.
- **WebRTC**: The backbone for low-latency Hybrid Meeting streaming.
- **Python (Flask/Daemon)**: For handling local **AV Routing** logic and hardware communication.
- **HTML5/Canvas**: For rendering Digital Signage content.
- **macOS Shell/Scripting**: For custom packaging and security compliance.
- **Firebase & Node.js**: For backend configuration and signaling.

## Challenges and Learnings

**Complex Signal Routing:**
One of the toughest technical hurdles was the **AV Routing** logic. Managing the state machine to switch between a physical HDMI cable plug-in, a wireless AirPlay stream, and a digital signage feed—without crashing the audio driver—required robust error handling and race-condition management in the Python layer.

**Optimizing Hybrid Latency:**
For **Hybrid Meetings**, ensuring that the room camera feed reached the user's laptop wirelessly with minimal delay was critical. I optimized the WebRTC media constraints and buffer handling to reduce latency by **40%**, ensuring lip-sync remained accurate during calls.

## Outcome

The Solstice platform now serves as a comprehensive room engine. The introduction of robust **AV Routing** and **Digital Signage** has transformed the product from a simple presentation tool into a critical enterprise asset, increasing device utilization uptime by over 30% for our clients.
